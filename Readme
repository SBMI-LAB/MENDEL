V16 Next merging state:
Purpose: Check multiple crossings between two strands.
Select which preserve taking into account the distance between
crossings
03/16/2020 05:16:19 PM -0400
Reducing crossing algorithm work initially.
Needs extra work for smarter decisions.

03/16/2020 07:08:21 PM -0400
New primitives added to build shapes based on coordinates.

V13 Updates



V12
Saved 2020-03-06
Basic goals of V11: Independence of Blender geometry.
Export scaffold successful. 
Stapple analysis reviewed: slow performance.
Saved for next iteration:
Classification of stapples by helix and position.
Take decision of allow or not a staple.


V11
Started 2020-03-03
Only store python code by version. 
Main goal:
Finalize independence of the software from Blender transformations
in the cadnano export
Other goals:
+ Split export module: Analysis and export

Ideas for next version:
Remove geometry generation during data structure creation.
Create instead Render commands. 
Render commands can be:
RenderSpheres: Render spheres as current version does
RenderRods: Render rods like cando
RenderHelices: Render curves for helices

And modifications:
RenderScaffold: Render only scaffold
RenderStapple: Render only stapple
RenderHelixSC(y,z): Render only scaffold of helix y,z
RenderStapple(y,z): Render only stapple of helix y,z




V10
Started 2020-03-03
Main goal: 
Make independent of Blender transformations
+ Incorporate internal coordinates of BP (no geometry coordinates)
+ Perform relative transformations for child (Next BP) and store as global

	2020-03-03
	Added basic support for independent transformations: Single helix
	* Required Turn calculations and compesations
	
	Added support for whole structure
	


V9
Started 2020-03-02
Requirements:
+ Fix starting point				* Done
+ Support for parallel helices		* Done


V8
Finished 2020-03-02
+ Bugfixes on staple clean 

V7
Started 2020-02-21
Requirements:
+ Save stapple data in cadnano file
+ Identify touching (or about to touch) link points             
+ Mark crossovers and create list of staples 


V6
Started 2020-02-20
Requirements:
+ Identify absolute orientation of BP and staples (link) points * Done
+ Identify touching (or about to touch) link points             * Next version
+ Mark crossovers and create list of staples                    * Next version


 *** Number of the rods has something to do with coordinates!

    Requirements promoted to next version
    2020-02-20:
    Multiple bugs fixed: Rod number depends of coordinates.
    Reestructuration of objects were required to get rid of the issue
    
    

Finished  2020-02-20



V5
Started 2020-02-18
Requirements:
+ Save scaffold data in cadnano file                * Done + bugs

    2020-02-19:
    Scaffold successfully stored in cadnano file
    Cadnano is able to open it
    Reading error happens when using a big structure,
    mainly when adding Z layers

    It is required to fix coordinates, to avoid negative ones.
    Probably, recompute coordinates before writing file, without
    moving geometries at all

    It is desired to allow the design get rid of blender
    construction functions, and only use them just to 
    previsualize final result (this could make the scripts
    independent of Blender, and can lead to an stand alone 
    program)

V4
Started 2020-02-17
Requirements:
+ Create turn functions for up XY                   * Done
+ Create turn functions for Z up and down           * Done
Finished 2020-02-18


V3  
Started 2020-02-14
Requirements:
+ Add contiuous scaffold, connected with previous	* Done
+ Determine absolute orientation of the BP			* Done
+ Determine automatic turn. Function required to 	* Done
  know when to stop 
+ Create turn functions for XY projection			* Done (only down)
+ Create turn functions for Z projection			* For next version

Issues: Blender requires window update to obtain the 
coordinates. The angle calculation was done taking
this into account.

V2 
Finished 2020-02-14
Solution for Blender performance
- Shapes are reutilized or created from scratch when required
- Automatic assignation of materials
- Function AddRow created with correct parameters

* It is required a function for correct turns. Currently setDirection 
  does, manually. Previous orientation is lost. 


V1
Basic creation of geometry
- Issues with Blender performance when the shapes are created
